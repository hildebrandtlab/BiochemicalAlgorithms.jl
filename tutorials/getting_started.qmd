title: Welcome to BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl
engine: julia

In this tutorial, you will learn about the basic concepts of the ```BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl``` library, a complete rewrite of the C++ framework [```BALL```](https://github.com/ball-project/ball) in Julia.

To use ```BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl``` in your code, add it to your project

```{julia}
#| eval: false

using Pkg
Pkg.add("BiochemicalAlgorithms")
```

and use it in your code:

```{julia}
#| output: false

using BiochemicalAlgorithms
```


## Representing molecular systems

In BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl, all molecules are stored in so-called ```Systems```. While a ```System``` can be created from scratch and filled programmatically, it is commonly created by reading a molecular file, such as a ```PDB```-file:

```{julia}
s = load_pdb(ball_data_path("../test/data/2ptc.pdb"))
```

You can then run methods on this system, e.g.

```{julia}
println("The system $(s.name) contains $(natoms(s)) atoms.")
```


### Common preparation steps

The data stored in many molecular file formats is incomplete, or needs to be normalized in certain ways. ```PDB```-files, for instance, often omit hydrogen atoms, and don't usually store bonds that can be inferred otherwise. ```BiochemicalAlgorithms.jl``` offers a number of methods that perform preparation steps that are common to most molecular modelling applications, such as normalizing atom- and fragment names, computing bonds, adding missing atoms from a library of templates (such as amino acids), or saturating a molecule with hydrogen atoms. The template information used by these methods is stored in the so-called ```FragmentDB```. A common series of operations to prepare a system for further processing is as follows:

```{julia}
fdb = FragmentDB()
normalize_names!(s, fdb)
reconstruct_fragments!(s, fdb)
build_bonds!(s, fdb)
```
